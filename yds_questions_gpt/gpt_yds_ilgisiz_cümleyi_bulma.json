      "corrected_question": "There is an old saying, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away and helps losing weight.\" In fact, studies have shown that a number of components in apples help the body to fight many diseases. Apples are also a source of dietary fibre which helps digestion and promotes weight loss. Blackberries and apples are a traditional duo for pies. Unlike other snacks such as biscuits, raw apples contain almost zero fat and cholesterol.",

      "corrected_question": "\"Wetten, dass?\", German for \"Wanna Bet That..?\", is a television show popular in German-speaking countries. The main attraction of the show is the bets. In 1981, the German channel ZDF aired the first episode. That is to say, common people offer to perform some unusual and very difficult task. The other major attraction of the show is the top-ranking celebrity guests who must bet on the outcome of one of the performances and offer a wager.",
