This was the inglorious defeat suffered by French troops as they made a last stand to hold onto their colonial empire in Indochina. Following World War II, French colonial officials and military forces returned to Indochina to reclaim their colonies. Vietnam, meanwhile, had declared its independence and asked the United States for help. The United States decided to back France instead. The Vietnamese, many of whom were Communists, started a guerrilla war against the French. The French steadily lost ground to tile nationalist Viet Minh forces. Late in 1953, the French occupied the town of Dienbienphu in an attempt to cut Vietnamese supply lines near the border with Laos. The Vietnamese responded by cutting all ground access to the city, so the French had to fly in all supplies. In the spring of 1954, the Vietnamese general, Vo Nguyen Giap, besieged Dientnenphu with 40,000 troops. They used artillery to batter the town's defenses and overran it on May 7. The first Indochina War was over, and on June 4, France and Vietnam signed a treaty giving Vietnam complete independence. This defeat, combined with events that were soon to unfold in Algeria, led to the collapse of France's Fourth Republic.\n\nThe author describes the Battle of Dienbienphu to be ................ .",

Her parents had hope for her. They had read Charles Dickens' report of the aid given to another blind and deaf girl, Laura Bridgman. When Helen was 6 years old, her parents took her to see Alexander Graham Bell, famed teacher of the deaf and inventor of the telephone. As a result of his advice, Anne Mansfield Sullivan began to teach Helen in 1887. Until her death in 1936, she remained Helen's teacher and constant companion. Sullivan had been almost blind in early life, but her sight had been partially restored. Helen soon learnt the finger-tip, or manual, alphabet as well as Braille — a system of writing for blind people, using raised dots which can be read by touch. By placing her sensitive fingers on the lips and throat of her teachers, she felt their motions and learnt to \"hear\" them speak. Three years after mastering the manual alphabet, she learnt to speak herself. \"Once I knew only darkness and stillness. . . . My life was without past or future. . . . But a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leapt to the rapture of living.\" This is how Helen Keller described the beginning of her \"new life\" when, despite blindness and deafness, she learnt to communicate with others.\n\nAccording to the passage one of the things which encouraged Helen's parents to think positively about their daughter's future was ....... .",

PRESERVING WILDLIFE IN NATIONAL PARKS \n\nThe wildlife of Africa has been greatly reduced in the past 50 years, partly as a result of overhunting and poaching and partly because large areas of their natural habitats have been taken over for farming.

These areas, called national parks, have tourist facilities that permit visitors to watch the animals in a natural setting.

The margin of victory was just 9,118 votes out of 1.63 million cast, prompting a recount which upheld the result. In 1986, Irish voters had rejected the divorce amendment by a 2-to-1 margin. According to political analysts, working-class residents of Dublin, the nation's capital, who accounted for one-third of Ireland's population, provided the crucial swing vote that determined the outcome. Analysts attributed the change in attitude since 1986 to several factors. Many cited as important the fact that the Irish government had passed 18 laws since the failed referendum covering property rights, child custody, child support and other issues related to divorce, because many people voting \"no\" in 1986 said that they did so because of inadequate laws covering the divisions of property in a divorce. Many analysts also pointed to the Irish government's 500,000-dollar promotional 'campaign in favour of lifting the divorce ban as an important factor in the amendment's passage. Opponents of the amendment, including the influential Roman Catholic church, said that they would challenge the result in the courts, pointing to the fact that the government's expenditure of public funds to promote the amendment was ruled illegal by the Irish Supreme Court. The amendment would allow people to divorce only if they have lived separately for at least four of the previous five years. There were approximately 80,000 legally separated people in Ireland in 1995. With Ireland's vote, Malta became the only European country to have a ban on divorce.\n\nThe likely cause of the change in attitude in Ireland in favour of allowing divorce was, according to the passage, a result of ........... .",

      "corrected_question": "In 1995, by a narrow vote of 50.28 percent to 49.72 percent, Irish voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing divorce. The margin of victory was just 9,118 votes out of 1.63 million cast, prompting a recount which upheld the result. In 1986, Irish voters had rejected the divorce amendment by a 2-to-1 margin. According to political analysts, working-class residents of Dublin, the nation's capital, who accounted for one-third of Ireland's population, provided the crucial swing vote that determined the outcome. Analysts attributed the change in attitude since 1986 to several factors. Many cited as important the fact that the Irish government had passed 18 laws since the failed referendum covering property rights, child custody, child support and other issues related to divorce, because many people voting 'no' in 1986 said that they did so because of inadequate laws covering the divisions of property in a divorce. Many analysts also pointed to the Irish government's 500,000-dollar promotional campaign in favour of lifting the divorce ban as an important factor in the amendment's passage. Opponents of the amendment, including the influential Roman Catholic Church, said that they would challenge the result in the courts, pointing to the fact that the government's expenditure of public funds to promote the amendment was ruled illegal by the Irish Supreme Court. The amendment would allow people to divorce only if they have lived separately for at least four of the previous five years. There were approximately 80,000 legally separated people in Ireland in 1995. With Ireland's vote, Malta became the only European country to have a ban on divorce.",

      "question_text": "-8. FIFTH DISEASE \n\nFifth disease is a mild but contagious, viral disease of children that causes a very characteristic facial rash. The formal name for the disease is erythema infectiosum, which means \"infectious rednees\". The name fifth disease was applied to the condition because it was the fifth pink-red infectious rash of childhood to be described, the others being scarlet fever, measles, rubella — often called German measles — and roseola. Although people of any age may contract fifth disease, children attending elementary school are the major group at risk. The virus causing this condition, human parvovirus B19, is spread by exposure to airborne droplets exhaled by an infected person. The disease is seen mainly in the spring months, and often occurs as an outbreak in a geographically limited region. More than half of the children who are exposed to fifth disease will contract the illness. After an incubation period ranging from four days to two weeks, an infected child usually has a fever of less than 38° C, may feel slightly ill or tired, and develops the most characteristic sign of fifth disease: bright red or rosy rash on both cheeks, making them look as if they have been slapped. In fact, the infection has been called \"slapped cheeks disease\". The rash does not itch, and may extend to the upper arms, thighs and buttocks, where it is more pink than bright red and has a lacy or netlike appearance. Children usually are no longer ill after five to ten days, but the rash often recurs a number of times over a period of several weeks. It seems to be triggered by exposure to direct sunlight, exercising or emotional stress. The child may continue in school or day care at this stage because once the rash appears, there is no longer any risk of giving the disease to others. The only treatment for the patient during the acute illness phase is bed rest. Drinking plenty of fluids is also important.\n\nThe details in the passage inform us that the group most affected by fifth disease is .......... .",

SPIES in CIA\n\nIn November 1996, for the second time in two years, a high-ranking CIA official was arrested for allegedly selling United States intelligence information to Russia. The FBI apprehended Harold J. Nicholson, who joined the CIA in 1980, and accused him of spying for Russia since 1994. According to the FBI, Nicholson sold the names of CIA agents operating in Russia to the Russian government. The motivation for Nicholson's betrayal, they believed, was purely monetary and was in no way ideologically charged. Nicholson was the highest ranking CIA official ever to be arrested for espionage. The most shocking aspect of his case was the fact that he began spying for Russia less than two weeks after another high-ranking CIA official, Aldrich Ames, had been arrested for serving as a Russian spy throughout the 1980s. The CIA estimated that the damage to United States intelligence work done by Nicholson, who had been under secret investigation since 1995, was considerably less than that done by Ames, who divulged information that compromised dozens of CIA operations and cost the lives of numerous agents. One indicator of the extent of the damage caused by the two spies, and of the changing times in the espionage game, could be gauged by their payoffs; whereas Nicholson had been paid an estimated $120,000 by Russian intelligence services, Ames reportedly received more than $2 million from the Soviets.\n\nAccording to the passage, it is clear that Harold J. Nicholson gave information to the Russian government ........ .",

      "question_text": "-10. CITY LIFE \n\nThe sociology of cities has been studied by many scholars who have issued divergent and conflicting reports on the question of what effect living in cities has on people. The single feature that distinguishes city rife from small-town or rural living is population: There are more people living more closely together in cities. There is no doubt that living in a major population centre can affect an individual's behaviour and emotional makeup. People in small towns are aware of informal social controls: What will the family think? What will the neighbours think? They know how quickly gossip gets passed around, so their social behaviour tends to be modified by this awareness. In a large city, these informal controls give way to formal ones — police, courts, jails, regulations and commands. The breakdown of informal controls throws individuals back on their own resources. Children in cities usually remain within the confines of the informal controls imposed by family, neighbours and friends. Adults, however, are more easily freed from these controls. To adults of strong character, this makes little difference. But to people whose lives are heavily influenced by what others think of them, the loss of informal controls can be quite unsettling. Such people can become lost in the crowd. Their personal contacts are superficial: They interact with other individuals only at those points where their life paths intersect — at work, at the grocery store, in restaurants, theatres or bar, on public transportation or at occasional social gatherings. In spite of hundreds of casual personal contacts, such individuals may be quite lonely. They may feel alienated from the rest of society, convinced that no one cares about them. This loneliness may promote mental illness or alcoholism, drug addiction or crime. Formal controls, because they are impersonal, are not nearly as effective as informal controls in regulating human behaviour.\n\nAccording to the passage, people in small towns, when compared with cities, ......... .",

He also won the reputation of being a tyrant the ruler who \"fiddled while Rome burned\" and who instigated the first persecution of Christians; however, Nero's unsavoury reputation is almost wholly undeserved. He was certainly hot the bloody dictator that Roman and Christian historians have depicted. Nero was born in the Mediterranean seaport of Antium. He was brought up by his mother Agrippina, a great-granddaughter of the emperor Augustus. She is noted for her relentless scheming to secure the fortunes of her son, killing those who stood in her way — including her uncle and third husband, the emperor Claudius. Agrippina's brother was the mad emperor Caligula. Nero became emperor in 54, and for the first five years his reign was exemplary. He stopped contests in the circus that involved bloodshed, banned capital punishment, reduced taxes, increased the independence of the Roman Senate and gave permission for slaves to bring complaints against their masters. He promoted competitions in poetry, theatre and athletics. In everything, he seemed to be pursuing the goal his teacher Seneca thought impossible — to remain innocent of all crime. The emergence of brutality and derangement in Nero occurred in 59, when he had his mother put to death. Her insanity and fury at him led him to this act. Three years later he had his wife Octavia killed. He also developed extraordinary pretensions as a poet, musician and actor, and became preoccupied with the mystery religions of Greece and the Middle East. In 66 he left Rome for 15 months of travel, in Greece to further his religious quest. Nero's religious obsessions and his artistic pretensions alienated many, including senators and the military. Yet he took little vengeance on his opponents. He was not in Rome when the city burned in 64 nor did he inaugurate a persecution of Christians because of the fire. The army became dissatisfied with his lack of attention to government, and he was soon deserted by all. He is believed to have killed himself in Rome in 68. For years afterward he was honoured, by the people, but later emperors destroyed his works and despised his memory.\n\nAccording to the passage, Nero became cruel and mad upon ......... .",

      "question_text": "-12. PAUL SERENO\n\n One fossil discovery after another gave University of Chicago professor Paul Sereno a reputation for having extraordinary luck. Sereno's \"luck\" was due in part to his willingness to go wherever the bones might be, however difficult and remote the site. His discoveries helped him piece together the family tree of dinosaurs. Sereno's discoveries began during graduate school. In 1984, as the first American graduate student of paleontology to study in China, he identified two new dinosaur species among the bones in Chinese fossil archives. When Chinese authorities rejected his application to dig in the Gobi desert of Mongolia, he took his request to a local official in Mongolia. Sereno explained in French that he wanted to hunt for the bones of big animals. The confused official admitted him under provisions for big-game hunters but offered little hope of finding much game in the desert. Sereno used his findings in China and Mongolia to make a family tree of the ornithischian, or bird-hipped, dinosaurs, one of the two main orders of dinosaurs. He based his work on careful comparison of details of various skeletons. The discovery that made Sereno famous came in 1988, the year after he completed his doctorate and joined the faculty at the University of Chicago. In a dry, dusty Argentina valley among sediments 225 million years old; he found the skull and a nearly complete skeleton of a Herrerasaurus, which, at the time, was the oldest dinosaur ever discovered. Less than a mile away three years later, Sereno found the complete skeleton of a 228-million-year-old dinosaur, which he named Eoraptor. Only six feet long, with sharp teeth and long claws, this earliest known dinosaur looked like a miniature version of Tyrannosaurus rex. It confirmed that dinosaurs began as small, meat-eating animals that walked and ran on their hind legs. Sereno was the first person to conduct extensive searches for dinosaur fossils in Africa. Governmental red tape and conditions in the Sahara desert made his expeditions to Niger in-1993 and Morocco in 1995 two of his most-gruelling, but also most rewarding.\n\nAccording to the author, Sereno's \"luck\" was actually a result of his ............. .",

      "question_text": "-14. THESEUS\n\nAccording to Greek legend, the hero Theseus, the son of Aegeus, king of Athens, was born and brought up in a distant land. His mother did not send him to Athens until he was a young man able to lift a stone under which his father had put a sword, and a pair of sandals. When Theseus arrived in Athens after many adventures, he found the city in deep mourning. It was again time to send to Minos, king of Crete, the yearly tribute of seven youths and seven maidens to be devoured by the Minotaur. This was a terrible monster, half human and half bull. Theseus offered himself as one of the victims, hoping that he would be able to slay the monster. When he reached Crete, Ariadne, the beautiful daughter of the king, fell in love with him. She aided him by giving him a sword, with which he killed the Minotaur, and a ball of thread, with which he was able to find his way out of the winding labyrinth where the monster was kept. Theseus had promised his father that if he succeeded in his quest he would hoist white sails on his ship when he returned; it had black sails when he left. He forgot his promise. King Aegeus, seeing the dark sails, thought his son was dead and jumped into the sea. The sea has since been called the Aegean in his honour. Theseus then became king of the Athenians. He united the village communities of the plain of Attica into a strong and powerful nation. Theseus was killed by treachery during a revolt of the Athenians. Later his memory was held in great reverence. At the battle of Marathon in 490 BC, many of the Athenians believed they saw his spirit leading them against the Persians. After the Persian Wars, the oracle at Delphi ordered the Athenians to find the grave of Theseus on the island of Skyros, where he had been killed, and to bring back his bones to Athens. The oracle's instructions were obeyed. In 469 BC, the supposed remains of Theseus were carried back to Athens. The tomb of the great hero became a place of refuge for the poor and oppressed people of the city.\n\nAccording to the Greek legend described in the passage, the Aegean Sea ............ .",

      "question_text": "-15. OSCEOLA (1804-38)\n\nThe leader of the Seminole Indians in their second war against the United States was Osceola. He was born about 1804 along the Tallapoosa River in Georgia. When he was 4, his family moved to Florida. As a boy he may have fought against Andrew Jackson in the First Seminole War. In 1832 some Seminole chiefs signed a treaty that called for them to move to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. Osceola and other young Seminoles opposed the move. In 1835 the Indian agent Wiley Thompson called a council at Fort Gibson. Some of the chiefs agreed to move. Osceola rose and plunged his dagger through the new treaty. He said, \"This is the only treaty I will make with the whites!\" He was then imprisoned. Later he pretended to favour the move and was released. In December the conflict began. Osceola knew that the Indians were no match for the white soldiers in open battle, so he led the Seminoles deep into the Everglades. From there he led the Seminole braves in fierce raids on the white soldiers and settlers. The American public criticised the conduct of the war, and finally General T.S. Jesup was given 8,000 men to end it. Some of the Seminole chiefs had given many braves as hostages for the move to Indian Territory. In June 1837 Osceola, with 200 warriors, liberated them and other Indians held by the Army. In October Osceola came under a flag of truce to confer with a subordinate of Jesup. Jesup ordered him seized. Osceola was imprisoned first at St. Augustine and later in Fort. Moultrie in Charleston. He died on January 20, 1838, and was buried with full military honours. The war dragged on until 1842, when most of the Seminole tribe surrendered and were moved to West.\n\nIt is clear from the passage that when Wiley Thompson met the Indian chiefs to discuss moving to Indian Territory, ......... .",

The immediate cause of the outburst was a jury verdict in Ventura County, north of the city, rendered earlier that day. Four white policemen were found not guilty of assault in the beating of an African American, Rodney lung. The incident had taken place on March 3, 1991, on the highway 210, north of Los Angeles. King and two passengers had led the police on a high-speed chase. When they were stopped, the two passengers quickly surrendered. Only King put up resistance. It happened that someone in the vicinity made a videotape of the beating incident — a tape that was played repeatedly on television across the country. The verdict surprised a nation that had witnessed the video but had not been informed of other evidence in the case. When the violence began, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley imposed a curfew, but the rioting and looting still lasted three days. On the second night, the looting and arson spread briefly to other parts of Los Angeles. When it was over, it had become the worst urban disturbance in 20th-century America. More than 54 people had been killed. More than 5,270 buildings had been destroyed or badly damaged. At least 4.000 people had been injured and more than 12,000 arrested. Thousands of jobs had been lost and whole neighbourhoods wiped out. The rioting got a head start on the police because the verdict was so unexpected and the reaction to it so sudden.\n\nOne reason given in the passage for the police being unprepared for the rioting was that ......... .",

      "question_text": "-17. THE FOOD-POPULATION RELATION\n\nIn 1798 the English economist Thomas Malthus published the first edition of his \"Essay on the Principle of Population\". In it he pointed out that population, when unchecked, increases geometrically — 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so forth, but food supply increases arithmetically — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so forth. Simply stated, his thesis suggests that increases in food supply cannot keep up with rapid increases in population. So the world population could, by natural increase, outstrip its ability to feed itself. Since Malthus' time, his theory has often been discounted by other economists and population experts as too pessimistic. But recent projections of population increase, coupled with the other problems facing the world's food supply, have earned him a renewed respect in some quarters. The world population in 1980 exceeded 4 billion. An unchecked increase would bring the total by 1985 to more than 6 billion. Even with the introduction of birth control policies in such populous societies as China, India, Latin America and Africa, the world population by the year 2020 could well exceed 10 billion. China has taken the lead in combating population increase by launching in 1979, a one-child family program. By this means China hopes to reach zero population growth by the end of the century. In India, Latin America and Africa, and other areas that do not have centrally planned economies, it will be far more difficult to limit growth. Religious and cultural factors play a significant role in attitudes toward the family and may prevent any effective birth control programs from being implemented.\n\nIt is clear from the passage that Malthus's theory ....... .",

The immediate cause of the war was a religious quarrel. In 1853 Czar Nicholas I of Russia demanded the right to protect Christian shrines in Jerusalem, then part of the Ottoman empire. As a first step, his troops moved into the Turkish Balkans. The Turkish sultan, counting on the support of Great Britain and France, refused the czar's demands. Great Britain feared its route to India would be cut off if Russia took Constantinople. Napoleon III, emperor of France, was eager to show that he was the true successor to his uncle, Napoleon I. War finally began in March 1854. By August, Turkey, with the help of Britain, France, and Sardinia, had driven the Russian forces out of the Balkans. In order to bring the war to a decisive end, the allied fleets proceeded to the Crimean peninsula. There their troops landed on September 16, 1854, and laid siege to the Russian fortress of Sevastopol'. Severe battles were fought in the Crimea at the Alma River, at Balaklava — immortalised in Tennyson's poem 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' — and at Inkerman. During the siege of Sevastopol', disease took a dreadful toll of French and British troops. Florence Nightingale's heroic work as head of the hospital service did much to improve conditions.

      "question_text": "-19. FIRDAWSI (935?-1026?)\n\nThe greatest poet of Persia — now Iran — was Abu ol-Qasem Mansur, who wrote under the name Firdawsi. He wrote the country's national epic, 'Book of Kings', in its final form. Of the man himself, little is known. The most reliable source of information is an account by a 12th-century poet, Nezamiye 'Aruzi, who visited Firdawsi's native village of Tus and collected stories about him. Firdawsi was born about 935, the son of a wealthy landowner. It was to earn money for his daughter's dowry that he began the 35-year task of composing the 'Book of Kings', or 'Shah-nameh' as it is called in Persian. The work, nearly 60,000 couplets long, was based on a prose work of the same name, itself a translation of a history of the kings of Persia from the most ancient times down to the reign of Khosrow II in the 7th. When the poem was completed in 1010, Firdawsi presented it to Mahmud, the sultan of Ghanza, in the hope of being well paid for it. In this the poet was disappointed: He considered his reward so paltry that he gave it away. This angered Mahmud, and Firdawsi fled to Herat, then to Mazanderan. Some years later, Mahmud tried to make amends to the poet by sending him a valuable amount of indigo. Unfortunately the shipment arrived at Tus on the same day that Firdawsi's body was being taken to the cemetery for burial. His daughter refused the award. The 'Book of Kings' has remained one of the most popular works in the Persian language. Modern Iranians understand it easily because the language in which it was written bears a relationship to modern Persian — a relationship similar to that between Shakespearean English and contemporary English.\n\nFrom the information given in the passage, Firdawsi's 'Book of Kings' could be described as .......... .",

Such misconduct includes failure to exercise the level of skill and learning expected of a licensed professional. The result of malpractice to the client or patient is injury, damage or some loss owing to professional incompetence. The official criteria for a valid medical malpractice claim are duty, breach, damages and causation. The practitioner must have had a relationship to the patient, which indicates that he or she had a duty to exercise ordinary .care; must have breached — failed to measure up — to that duty, according to the applicable standard of care; and because of that breach must have caused the patient physical and monetary damages. If there is evidence of malpractice, a client may sue in a civil action, seeking damages in the form of money. Those most likely to be sued are surgeons, since malpractice is much easier to prove when a surgical operation has been done. If, for example, a surgeon leaves a foreign object inside a closed wound, the surgeon is clearly liable for the carelessness. Plastic surgeons are most at risk, since their operations are done to improve the patient's appearance. Dissatisfied patients may sue. Medical malpractice actions do three things: provide quality control for the medical profession; provide some measure of compensation for the harm done; and give emotional vindication to the plaintiff, which is a measure of his or her ability to make a complaint and receive a satisfactory response.\n\nOf these, quality control is probably best achieved.

      "question_text": "-21. GRAND CANYON\n\nNature's greatest example of sculpture, the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona is the most spectacular canyon in the world. It is a 446-kilometre gorge cut through high plateaus by the Colorado River. It is noted for its fantastic shapes and colours. Within the walls of the canyon stand imposing peaks, canyons and ravines. In general, the colour of the canyon is red, but each layer or group of layers has a distinctive hue — buff and gray, delicate green and pink, and, in its depths, brown, slate-gray and violet. The canyon extends in a winding course from the mouth of the Paria River, near the northern boundary of Arizona, to Grand Wash Cliffs, near the Nevada line. Grand Canyon National Park, which has 493,076 hectares, was established in 1919. Its area was greatly enlarged in 1975 by the addition of adjoining lands so that it now extends from Lake Powell to Lake Mead. The north and south rims of the canyon are connected by a paved road and by a trans-canyon trail. Scenic drives and trails lead to all important features. Mule-pack trips and river rafting are popular ways of viewing and experiencing the beauty of the vast canyon. The gorge has many rapids. Many cliff-dweller ruins indicate prehistoric occupation. There are several Indian tribes living on nearby reservations. No other place on the Earth compares with the mile-deep Grand Canyon for its record of geological events. Some of the canyon's rocks date back about 4 billion years. The river's speed and such \"cutting tools\" as sand, gravel and mud account for its incredible cutting capacity. The canyon has many varieties of wildlife. Willow trees and cottonwoods grow at the bottom of the canyon where there is plenty of water. There are magnificent forests on the north rim of the canyon where the soil is moist and deep. There are also drought-resistant plants, including numerous species of cactus. The first sighting of the Grand Canyon by Europeans is credited to the Coronado expedition of 1540. In 1869 John Wesley Powell organised the first party to go through the canyon. His account remains a classic of American travel.\n\nBy the 1870s extensive reports on the area were being published.  It is clear that in the opinion of the author, the Grand Canyon ........ .",

      "question_text": "-22. CYRUS FIELD (1819-92)\n\nThe businessman Cyrus Field, who had entered the paper business when he was 21, and retired at 33 with a fortune, promoted the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. He had no technical knowledge to qualify him for the task, but he was a brilliant and persuasive organiser. He also had a determination that overcame repeated failures. The idea of laying a transatlantic cable was not new, but because of the great depths and distance involved, no one had promoted it. In 1854 a Canadian engineer interested Field in laying a cable from St. John's, Newfoundland, to the Canadian mainland. This would speed receipt of European news by several days. While studying a globe, Field decided that the cable should be extended to Ireland. Laying the Canadian cable took two and a half years. By that time Field had organised companies in the United States and Great Britain to raise funds for an Atlantic cable between the two countries. The first four cables broke, causing heavy losses to investors. The fifth was completed on August 5, 1858. On August 15, Queen Victoria and President James Buchanan exchanged messages on the new cable. Soon, however, the signals became unintelligible, and in October they ceased. Undeterred, Field raised additional funds. After another failure in 1865, the fight was finally won on July 27, 1866.\n\nAccording to the passage, Cyrus Field completed the laying of a transatlantic cable ......... .",

The ships came from north German cities belonging to the Hanseatic League, which was at war with the king of Denmark. For two years, the ships harassed the Danish coasts and waters, sacked Danish cities, and carried off their treasures. At the end of that time, the king of Denmark made peace, but the terms were humiliating. The cities of the league demanded a share in the Danish revenues for 15 years, the possession of Danish strongholds, and the final voice in the selection of the Danish kings. This episode in the history of the loose confederation of north German cities known as the Hanseatic League gives an idea of the power it then possessed. The league had developed gradually. More than a hundred years before the action against Denmark, a few cities had formed alliances to protect their traders from plundering barons along land routes and from marauding pirates upon the seas. These alliances proved so useful that gradually more towns joined the strongest league, of which Lubeck was the centre, and this union became known as the Hanseatic League. No one knows just how many towns were in the league. Even its ambassadors in London, when asked for the number of towns, replied that they could not be expected to know all the places, large and small, in whose name they spoke.

Lions, tigers and other cats were kept in one house; monkeys in another; birds in another. Single animals in bare cages were not very interesting to the visitors, however. Many animals that live in groups in the wild also did not adapt well to living alone. Modern zoos present the animals by showing them in surroundings that resemble as closely as possible their natural habitats. Visitors to a modern zoo can look across a plain and see lions seemingly free to wander. Nearby are birds, with antelopes and zebras feeding at the edge of a water hole. The other animals are not afraid of the lions because they are separated from them by wide, deep trenches, or moats. These moats also separate the visitors from the animals in the exhibit. The moats are often hidden with plants, and the visitor frequently does not notice them. The animals appear to be living wild in their natural settings. Often what appear to visitors as real trees, rocks and vines, however, are in fact artificial. These naturalistic parts of the exhibit are built of durable materials and designed to withstand rough treatment by the animals.\n\nAccording to the passage, zoos nowadays are noted for ------ .",

He was a hero to Mexicans who resented the prejudice they faced in the United States. Some scholars today believe his story to be no more than a legend.

Miners in the United States resented the competition from Mexican miners. In 1850, California passed the Greaser Act and Foreign Miners Act, which discouraged Mexican prospecting in California.

One of Italy's major composers, Ottorino Respighi, enshrined them in two richly descriptive symphonic poems. Books about Rome's fountains published in Italian, French and English have contributed to their fame. The best known is Niccolo Salvi's 18th-century Fountain of Trevi. It is a tradition for visitors to cast small coins into its churning waters, allegedly to ensure their eventual return to Rome for Christians, and for others, to ensure that their dreams have come true. The most imaginative fountain is probably Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers. Another by Bernini is the graceful Fountain of the Triton on the Piazza Barberini. In the Piazza della Repubblica is the colossal Fountain of the Naiads. Its charming beauties wrestle with seaborne monsters. The Fountain of the Barcaccia in the Piazza di Spagna was designed like a leaking boat by Bernini's father, Pietro.

      "corrected_question": "-6. ROME'S FOUNTAINS\n\nMost great cities have beautiful fountains, but in Rome they are a living part of the city. Italian poets have immortalised them in verse. One of Italy's major composers, Ottorino Respighi, enshrined them in two richly descriptive symphonic poems. Books about Rome's fountains published in Italian, French and English have contributed to their fame. The best known is Niccolo Salvi's 18th-century Fountain of Trevi. It is a tradition for visitors to cast small coins into its churning waters, allegedly to ensure their eventual return to Rome for Christians, and for others, to ensure that their dreams have come true. The most imaginative fountain is probably Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers. Another by Bernini is the graceful Fountain of the Triton on the Piazza Barberini. In the Piazza della Repubblica is the colossal Fountain of the Naiads. Its charming beauties wrestle with seaborne monsters. The Fountain of the Barcaccia in the Piazza di Spagna was designed like a leaking boat by Bernini's father, Pietro.

THE PYRENEES\n\n Of all Europe's mountain ranges, the jagged and often snow-capped Pyrenees, 435 kilometres long, have functioned most effectively as a barrier to human movement. Unlike the Alps, the Pyrenees have no low foothills or hospitable valleys to ease access into and through their heights. Rather, the Pyrenees rise abruptly from the flanking plains of France and Spain with only steep gorges and steep-walled natural amphitheatres that lead to almost impassable lofty summits. The French peasant's maxim, \"Africa begins with the Pyrenees,\" is not without a large measure of truth in emphasizing the historic significance of the Pyrenees as a barrier in the development of Spain. In the words of the American historian Will Durant, Spain's mountains, particularly the Pyrenees, \"were her protection and tragedy: they gave her comparative security from external attack, but hindered her economic advance, her political unity and her participation in European thought.\"\n\nThe passage tells us that the Pyrenees ------ .",

      "question_text": "- 11. OWNER OF A SAMURAI ARMY \n\nHe was a novelist who had his own samurai army, and he was an intellectual who worked at body building. The brilliant Japanese writer Yukio Mishima was a man torn between Japanese tradition and the westernization of his culture. He was born as Hiraoka Kimitake on January 14, 1925, in Tokyo, Japan, but as an adult, he published under the name Yukio Mishima. He attended Tokyo's Peers School and the University of Tokyo. Mishima's writing career took off with the 1949 publication of his first novel, Confessions of a Mask. A man of discipline and great energy, he usually wrote from midnight until dawn, and in his lifetime, produced more than 100 works, including novels, short stories, traditional Japanese No and Kabuki plays and screenplays. He even starred in a film version of his short story Patriotism. One of his best-known novels is The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, published in 1958. Although Mishima enjoyed many benefits from the westernisation of Japan, he was troubled by the changes wrought on traditional Japanese ways. This was a common theme in his stories. His last work, Sea of Fertility, compares modern Japan to the barren landscape of the moon. In an effort to recapture the samurai tradition, Mishima organised a private army called the Shield Society. On November 25, 1970, Mishima and four society members took control of an office at military headquarters in Tokyo.

Practised since ancient times in many parts of the world, aquaculture embraces such diverse activities as the Chinese tradition of growing carp in ponds, the harvesting and processing of seaweed in Iceland and the artificial culture of pearls — a Japanese invention. Aquaculture can take place in water that is still or in running water, fresh or salt. The practice of aquaculture has been growing rapidly. Experts have projected a five-fold increase in harvests during the final quarter of the 20th century. In the 1970s, Asia accounted for approximately 85 percent of world production in the field. Aquaculture is regarded as one possible solution to the world's food supply problems. The quantity of tillable land is limited and shrinking everywhere. But two thirds of the globe is covered with water; the supply of food animals and plants that may be grown there is almost limitless. In contrast to agriculture, which is practised on the land's surface only, aquaculture is three-dimensional. Within the same vertical region, several different crops can be grown at once — near the water surface, on the bottom and in the area between.

In ancient Egypt, where the idea originated, the head was usually a portrait of the reigning pharaoh. It also represented the sky-god Horus. The Egyptians always pictured their kings as calm and stately, with wide-open, staring eyes. The lion's body -symbolising courage — is crouched with its front feet outstretched. From Egypt the idea of the sphinx spread to the Syrians and Phoenicians and finally to the Greeks. These peoples gave the creature the head and bust of a woman. They added an eagle's wings to represent majesty and a long serpent's tail to indicate wiliness. In later Greek literature, the sphinx was no monster, but a beautiful, wise and mysterious woman. The Great Sphinx at Giza was carved in about 2600 BC. It stands near the three great pyramids, gazing across the Nile, to the east. The head is a portrait of Khafre, a pharaoh of the Old Kingdom. Near the sphinx rises Khafre's tomb, the second of the three great pyramids.\n\nAccording to the passage, Egyptian sphinxes ------ .",

      "question_text": "- 17. THE SENSORY RECEPTORS of ANIMALS\n\nAnimals, like humans, use their ability to see, hear, smell, taste and touch to respond to the world around them. But a good many animals also have special sensory receptors that help them as they move about and search for food. Some birds use the sun and stars to navigate. But when the sun or stars are not visible, birds must rely on other senses. The barnacle geese, for example, can detect the magnetic forces that surround the Earth. This special sense helps them know where they are in relation to the Earth's poles. Dolphins use a similar ability to detect the magnetic landmarks around them as they swim and search for food in murky waters. Locust use their eyes and antennae to navigate and to regulate their flying speed. By looking at the ground, they can determine how fast they are going. And if their antennae bend too much in the wind, they will slow down. A group of mackerel are able to swim together, even in the dark, without bumping into each other. They can do this because of a lateral-line organ that runs the length of its body. This organ detects movement in the water, such as ripples made by other fish, and helps the mackerel navigate and avoid its enemies. The thornback ray, like many other fish, has the ability to sense the small amounts of electricity given off by nerve impulses or muscle contractions. Pores around the ray's mouth pick up these electrical discharges and help the ray as it hunts for food. Some snakes, like the North American cottonmouth, have a special pit organ underneath their eyes that senses the heat given off by animals. The organ helps the snake find its prey, even in the dark of night. These are but a few examples of animals with special senses. These senses help them detect a wide variety of stimuli in the world around them as they move about and search for food.\n\nAccording to the passage, a great number of animals ------ .",

PELE, THE LEGEND in SOCCER\n\n\"Soccer in its purest form\" was played by Pele, a South American superstar who was the world's most famous and highest-paid athlete when hejoined a North American team in 1975. He led the Brazilian national soccer team to three World Cup victories in 1958, 1962 and 1970 and to permanent possession of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Edson Arantes do Nascimento was born to a poor family on October 23. 1940, in Tres Coracoes, Brazil. He began playing for a local minorleague club when he was a teenager. He made his debut with the Santos Football Club in 1956. With Pele at inside left forward, the team won several South American clubs' cups and the 1962 world club championship, in addition to the three World Cup championships.Pele scored his 1,000th goal in 1969. The legendary athlete retired in 1974 but made a comeback in 1975, reportedly, after accepting a 7-million-dollar contract for three years with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. He said he came out of retirement, not for the money, but to \"make soccer truly popular in the United States.\" His farewell appearance was against his old Santos club in 1977.Pele, whose nickname does not mean anything, became a Brazilian national hero and was also known as Perola Negra, meaning Black Pearl. An average-sized man, he was blessed with speed, great balance, tremendous vision, the ability to control the ball superbly and the ability to shoot powerfully and accurately with either foot and with his head. In his career he played in 1,363 matches and scored 1,281 goals. His best season was 1958, when he scored 139 times. In addition to his accomplishments in sports, he published several best-selling autobiographies, starred in several documentary and semi-documentary films, and composed numerous musical pieces, including the entire sound track for the film 'Pele', in 1977. He was the 1978 recipient of the International Peace Award, and in 1980, he was named athlete of the century.\n\nIt is clear from the passage that until 1975 ------ .",

      "question_text": "-19. A BRIEF HISTORY of SPECIAL EDUCATION\n\n Modern special education got its start in Spain during the 16th century with classes for the deaf. Pedro Ponce de Leon was able to teach deaf students to speak, read and write. A successor of Leon, Juan Pablo Bonet, adopted the same methods and published a book on the subject in 1620. The success of teaching the deaf in Spain soon aroused interest in the problem throughout Europe. In France, in the 18th century, Charles-Michel developed a sign language for the deaf for use both as a means of teaching and for ordinary conversation. Attempts to educate the blind were not undertaken until the end of the 18th century. The first outstanding teacher was Valentin Hauy of France, who has been called the \"father and apostle of the blind.\" He opened an institute for blind children in Paris in 1784. Following his success, similar schools were established over the next 25 years in Liverpool, Vienna, London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Zurich. Schools for the blind were founded in Boston, Mass., and New York City in 1832. Attempts to teach the mentally retarded also started in France, but not until the early 19th century. The first significant efforts were made by a physician named Jean-Marc-Gaspard Itard, who had devoted much time and money to teaching deaf-mutes. His now-classic book, The Wild Boy of Aveyron, tells how he succeeded in educating an uncivilised 11-year-old boy who had been found living in a forest. Itard's work was taken up by Edouard Seguin, a French psychiatrist. He opened a school for the mentally retarded in 1839 that became internationally known. In 1848 he immigrated to the United States. There he founded the Seguin Psychological School in Orange, N.J. His work, in turn, influenced Maria Montessori, one of the most widely acclaimed innovators in modern schooling.\n\nAccording to the passage, sign language ------ .",

He . was the 27th president of the United States and later, between 1921-30, the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court. No man was better fitted for these posts by long years of experience. He had been in public office almost continuously since 1881. He was the first civil governor of the Philippines and secretary of war in President Theodore Roosevelt's Cabinet, only two of the many high positions he held. His large size and his famous chuckle made Taft a memorable figure. He was 5 feet 11 inches tall, with fair complexion, clear blue eyes and light hair. At the time he was president, he weighed 350 pounds. He joked about his bulk and took no offence at the jokes of others. Asked to accept a \"chair of law\" at Yale University, he replied that he would if they could make it a \"sofa of law\". Chairs were a problem. He always \"looked before he sat\" to avoid armchairs or antiques in which he might get stuck or collapse. When he was governor of the Philippines, Taft made a trip into the mountains for the benefit of his health. He cabled Secretary of War Elihu Root: \"Stood trip well. Rode horseback 25 miles to 5,000 feet elevation.\" Root cabled back: \"Referring to your telegram . . . how is the horse?\" His biographer, Henry F. Pringle, has described the Taft chuckle: \"It was by all odds the most infectious chuckle in the history of politics. It started with a silent trembling of Taft's ample stomach. The next sign was a pause in the reading of his speech, and the spread of a slow grin across his face. Then came a kind of gulp which seemed to escape without his being aware that the climax was near. Laughter followed hard on the chuckle itself, and the audience invariably joined in.\"\n\nAccording to the passage, William Howard Taft is an easily remembered personality because of his ------ .",

JAMES HARGREAVES\n\nThe obscurity of James Hargreaves's life contrasts sharply with the worldwide influence of his invention, a yarn-spinning machine called the spinning jenny. Almost nothing is known of his life. He was probably born in Blackburn in Lancashire. England. While still a boy, he became a carpenter and spinner in Standhill, a village nearby. At that time Lancashire was the centre of England's manufacture of cotton goods. The industry was still confined to workers' homes, however, and the cards, spinning wheels and looms were operated by hand. It is said that an accident gave Hargreaves the idea for his spinning jenny. In his crowded cottage, which served him both as home and workshop, he was experimenting with spinning two threads at one time. His experiments were unsuccessful, however, because the horizontal spindles allowed the threads to fly apart and become tangled. After his daughter Jenny overturned the experimental machine and its wheel continued to revolve with the spindles in a vertical position, it occurred to Hargreaves that a machine with spindles in this position might be successful. He proceeded to build a spinning machine, probably in 1764, that would spin eight threads at the same time.

However, male domination of this game experienced a shock when three Hungarian sisters moved into the front line of world-class players. The feats of the Polgar sisters at early ages, in fact, matched or surpassed some of those of the greatest male players. In December 1991, at the age of 15, the youngest sister, Judit, achieved the rank of grandmaster against male competition, replacing Bobby Fischer as the youngest person in chess history to have won this honour. Although Susan was the eldest, she ranked as the number two woman player in the world behind Judit, who was acclaimed number one. The other sister, Sofia, lagged a bit behind: she was \"only\" the world's sixth-ranked woman player, though, according to their father, Laszlo, Sofia was the most talented of the three. The chess-playing Polgar sisters, according to their father, achieved their uncommon abilities as the result of a carefully planned educational program. A psychologist, Polgar held a theory that \"geniuses\" are made, not born, and that early training and specialisation were the key. He set out to prove his theory and determined that his children would focus on chess when Susan at the age of 4 expressed interest in the game. From that time Susan -and the others, when they came along — were immersed in a chess environment.

The village commemorates the period in Japan's history from 1603 to 1867, called the Tokugawa shogunate, when warlords called shoguns ruled the country. The warriors of the shoguns were called samurai. By the 12th century, the ability of the emperor and his court to govern effectively had diminished. It was then that the samurai emerged as a distinct social class. They were held together by personal loyalty to powerful chiefs — the shoguns - who brought more territory under their control. Local wars among the chieftains continued for generations until finally, under the Tokugawa shogunate, the whole nation was united under one warlord. From the end of the 12th century until the Meiji Restoration, or resumption of the emperor's authority, in 1868, government was exclusively in the hands of the samurai class. The behaviour of the samurai was strictly regulated by a code of conduct called Bushido, which is translated as \"way of the warrior.\" The idea of the code developed in about the 13th century, and it encompassed the ideals of loyalty and sacrifice. By the 19th century, it had become the basis of ethical training for the whole of Japanese society, and it contributed significantly to the tough Japanese nationalism and morale exhibited during World War II.\n\nWe learn from the passage that the samurai came into existence as a separate class ------ .",

An old Italian proverb says, \"See Naples and die!\" It testifies to the enduring attraction of this remarkable city, the third largest city in Italy and one of the most beautiful in the world. Approximately 190 kilometres southeast of Rome, the city is on the north side of the Bay of Naples. The bay juts into the western side of the Italian peninsula with Mount Vesuvius in the background. One of the centres of activity is the Piazza Trento e Trieste near the waterfront. It is flanked by two imposing buildings, the Teatro San Carlo and the Palazzo Reale. The theatre is one of Europe's largest and foremost opera houses, dating from 1737. The palace dates from 1600, originally the home of the viceroys who governed Naples during its period of Hapsburg domination. It now houses the National Library. East of these buildings and overlooking the harbour is the Castel Nuovo, begun in 1279. It houses, among other things, the Naples City Council and the Campania Regional Council. Directly south of the piazza is the Castel dell'Ovo. Built on what was an island now connected with the mainland to form the Porto di Santa Lucia, the castle dates from 1154. To the west of Santa Lucia is the Villa Comunale, a large park with Naples's aquarium.\n\nWe learn from the passage that Naples is located ------ .",

POSSESSING A MATHEMATICAL MIND\n\nSeveral old jokes common amongst the scientific disciplines illustrate the difference between the mathematical mind and that of other disciplines. One goes as follows: An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician are all staying at a hotel one night when a fire breaks out. The engineer wakes up and smells the smoke; he quickly grabs a garbage pail to use as a bucket, fills it with water from the bathroom, and puts out the fire in his room. He then refills the pail and douses everything flammable in the room with water. He then returns to sleep. The physicist wakes up, smells the smoke, jumps out of bed. He picks up a pad and pencil and makes some calculations, glancing frequently at the flames. He then measures exactly 15.6 litres of water into the garbage pail, and throws it on the flames, which are extinguished. Smiling, he returns to sleep. Finally the mathematician wakes up. He too grabs a pad and begins fervently writing, glancing at the flames, and then writing more. After a while, he gets a satisfied look on his face; entering the bathroom, he produces a match, lights it, and then extinguishes it with a bit of running water. \"Aha!

Although he is one of the most popular saints honoured by Christians, very little is actually known about him. He lived during the 4th century in Lycia, a province on the southwest coast of Asia Minor. Tradition says he was born in Patara, a seaport, and travelled to Egypt and Palestine as a young man. Eventually he became bishop of the church at Myra. During the period of persecution of Christians by Emperor Diocletian, he was imprisoned but was released by Diocletian's successor, Constantine the Great. By the 6th century his burial shrine was well known at Myra. In 1087 his remains were moved to Bari, Italy, which became a crowded pilgrimage centre. Devotion to him spread throughout the Christian world, and thousands of churches throughout Europe were named after him. His feast day was set on December 6. The transformation of St. Nicholas into Santa Claus began in Germany,where he was called Kriss Kringle, derived from Christkindle, meaning \"Christ child\", and he became permanently associated with the Christmas season and gift giving. From there his legend spread to France, where he was called Pere Noel. In the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, now New York City, he was called Sinter Claes, which easily became Santa Claus.As Christmas became more widely celebrated, the legend grew. In 1823 Clement C. Moore wrote A Visit from St. Nicholas, portraying Santa Claus riding in a sleigh drawn by \"eight tiny reindeer\", the same mode of travel he uses in Scandinavia.

WHEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP \n\nPerhaps more good swimmers have been drowned by cramp than by anything else, and only those who have suffered from it can conceive its fatal power. Good swimmers, when seized with cramp, have been known to sink instantly, overcome with the sudden pain and nothing can save the victim but the greatest presence of mind. The usual spot where the cramp is felt is the calf of the leg; and it sometimes comes with such violence that the muscles are gathered up into knots. There is only one method of proceeding under such circumstances: Turn on the back at once, kick out the leg in the air, disregarding the pain, and rub the spot smartly with one hand, while the other is employed in paddling towards shore. These directions are easy enough to give, but most difficult to be obeyed; cramp seems to deprive the sufferer of all reason for the time, and to overpower him with mingled pain and terror. Therefore, the method of saving a person drowning because of cramp demands great practice. The chief difficulty lies in the fact that a person who cannot swim feels, in deep water, much as if he were falling through air, and consequently clutches instinctively at the nearest object. And if he succeeds in grasping the person who is trying to save him, both will probably sink together. Every precaution should be taken to prevent such a misfortune and the drowning man should always be seized from behind, and pushed as he is in front.\n\nAccording to the passage, although the correct course of action for cramp is simple, ------ .",

They refer to themselves as backpackers because they can be roughly defined as travellers that travel with a rucksack instead of a suitcase. Backpackers need specialised equipment that is both durable and extremely lightweight. Tents, sleeping bags cook stoves and even special food that is light enough to be carried for great distances can be purchased at stores that sell camping equipment. Most gear is carried in a backpack. A typical American backpack is designed to be attached to a metal frame that distributes the weight evenly across the wearer's shoulders and hips. Rucksacks, backpacks without metal frames, are more popular in Europe. Backpackers often go hiking and camping, backpacking in the other sense, but they more often explore more urban settings. United in having slim wallets as well as a passion for the exotic, they seek out low-cost options such as standby flights, youth hostels, and buying food at supermarkets abroad instead of going to restaurants. They often assemble in beautiful places with low costs of living such as Goa (India), Essaouira (Morocco), or Thailand. They are generally very social, and a highlight for many backpackers is meeting others like themselves on the road.

But it has evolved to include any decorations inscribed on rocks or walls that are considered to be vandalism. However, some people consider graffiti, or some graffiti, an art form; this is usually denoted as urban Aerosol Art. The practices of graffiti and of considering graffiti as art are generally related to a subculture that rebels against extant societal authorities, or against authority as such. Graffiti art is considered one of the four elements of the Hip Hop Culture. Although existing previously in primitive form, it wasn't until it reached popularity in the New York City subway system that it took on an extravagant artistic role. The founder or inspiration is noted as TAKI 183; a teenage pizzaboy who would tag his nickname in marker within every subway-car that he daily got on. After being showcased in the newspaper, the intricate \"tag\" was being mimicked by hundreds of urban youth within months.

      "corrected_question": "Graffiti originally was the term used for inscriptions, figure drawings, etc. found on the walls of ancient ruins, as in the Catacombs, or at Pompeii. But it has evolved to include any decorations inscribed on rocks or walls that are considered to be vandalism. However, some people consider graffiti, or some graffiti, an art form; this is usually denoted as urban Aerosol Art. The practices of graffiti and of considering graffiti as art are generally related to a subculture that rebels against extant societal authorities, or against authority as such. Graffiti art is considered one of the four elements of the Hip Hop Culture. Although existing previously in primitive form, it wasn't until it reached popularity in the New York City subway system that it took on an extravagant artistic role. The founder or inspiration is noted as TAKI 183; a teenage pizzaboy who would tag his nickname in marker within every subway-car that he daily got on. After being showcased in the newspaper, the intricate \"tag\" was being mimicked by hundreds of urban youth within months. With the innovation of art, and the craving to gain the widest audience, attempts by taggers were made.

      "question_text": "-11. SIR JAMES PAUL McCARTNEY \n\nPaul McCartney was born in Liverpool, England, to Mary and James McCartney. Paul's introduction to music was through his father, who was the founder of Jim Mac's Jazz Band. It was shortly after his mother's death from breast cancer in 1956 that McCartney immersed himself in learning to play the guitar. His mastery of early rock 'n' roll songs impressed his friends and created an opportunity for him to join John Lennon in a local group that would later become The Beatles. McCartney, who is most famous for playing bass in the band, composed many memorable songs, including 'Yesterday\" (1965), \"Eleanor Rigby\" (1966), \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967), \"Hey Jude\" (1968), and \"Let It Be\" (1969). His willingness to sign autographs, pose for pictures, and give interviews caused the mass media to dub him \"the cute Beatle\". That title, combined with the prevalent early-1960s belief that the rock genre of music lacked artistic merit, often obscured McCartney's contribution to the music of the Beatles. His expertise in harmony and melody complemented Lennon's love of word play and basic rock 'n' roll and helped create many of the vocal and bass lines that have become the trademarks of the Beatles' musical style. As half of the Lennon-McCartney song writing team, he created some of the best known popular music of the 20th Century. McCartney was a member of The Beatles, between 1962 and 1970, the founder of Wings, which performed from 1971 to 1980, and has, in more recent years, enjoyed success as a solo recording artist, a composer of classical music, a painter, a poet and a businessman.\n\nThe author explains that the press nicknamed Paul McCartney the cute Beatle because ------ .",

      "question_text": "-12. THE MISSION OF APOLLO 13\n\nApollo 13 was an American space mission, part of the Apollo program. It was intended to be the third mission to land on the Moon. An oxygen tank in the Service Module exploded while the spacecraft was on its way to the Moon requiring the mission to be aborted: the Moon landing was cancelled and only a single pass around the Moon was made. Considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from both the crew and the ground controllers to figure out how to jury-rig the craft for the crew's safe return, with much of the world watching the drama on television. Reentry in the Earth's atmosphere required the unusual step of undocking the lunar module, which had been retained for the flight back to Earth, in addition to the separation of the damaged service module. The lunar module had remained attached to the spacecraft to provide emergency propulsion and life support. The crew returned unharmed on the Earth. In the wake of the near-disaster, NASA appointed a review board under the leadership of Edgar M. Cortright, director of Langley Research Center, to investigate the Apollo 13 accident. After some three months of study, the cause of the explosion was traced to two inadequate thermostatic switches in an oxygen-tank heater assembly. Dysfunction of the switches under load caused overheating that led to an insulation fire, and the subsequent blast tore a side panel from the service module and disabled the fuel cells. Other defects in manufacture and in testing procedures were also found. Further Apollo flights were delayed until 1971 so that modifications could be made to prevent similar incidents. Jim Lovell, who was one of the crew members, wrote a book about the mission, Lost Moon, which was later turned into a successful movie, Apollo 13, starring Tom Hanks.\n\nAccording to the passage, the plan to return the Apollo 13's crew safely to the Earth ------ .",

      "question_text": "-13. IRISH TRADITIONAL MUSIC Irish traditional music is the folk music of the Irish people as well as of the descendants of Irish emigrants in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Irish traditional music as it is known today is the result of a centuries-old tradition of melodically-rich dance music and song. It was formerly played without harmonic accompaniment such as guitar and usually learned \"by ear\" rather than from written music. Irish dance music is distinctively lively, and Irish songs are often highly ornamented. This music is contrasted with the Irish pub ballad tradition, which has made, for example, the song \"Whiskey in the Jar\" famous, and the modern \"folk\" tradition, as well as what goes under the name \"Celtic music\". The term \"Celtic music\" usually combines Irish traditional music with various other traditional musics, including those of Scotland and the Shetland Islands; Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada; Wales; the Isle of Man; Northumberland, northern England; Brittany, northwest France; and sometimes Galicia in northwestern Spain. The term, though widely used, is eschewed by many traditionalists. While once mostly home-made by non-professionals for their own entertainment and that of their neighbours and friends, now Irish music can be heard at informal gatherings of musicians, often in pubs, and in concert halls, not only in Ireland and countries with large Irish immigrant populations, but indeed in many countries around the globe. The Irish song tradition is diverse and rich. It enjoys a prominent place among the interrelated song traditions of Scotland, England and\" North America. Irish songs, with plaintive or sprightly melodies to suit their themes, cover many subjects: love and betrayal, everyday country life and occupations and historical or newsworthy events.\n\nAccording to the passage, Irish traditional music ------ .",

THE FATE OF CONCORDE\n\nConcorde was considered to be the safest airliner in the world as measured by passenger-deaths per passenger-mile, until a plane crashed during take-off in Paris on July 25, 2000, which killed 113 people. As a result, all Concorde flights were shut down for an investigation into the cause of the crash and possible remedies. After safety updates on the aircraft, both routes were reopened on November 7, 2001. The investigation into the crash determined that a scrap of titanium metal that fell onto the runway from an earlier Continental Airlines DC-10 flight punctured a tyre in the latter stages of take-off. Chunks of shredded tire penetrated the skin of the aircraft's wing, rupturing a loaded fuel tank. A tremendous fire rapidly ensued, disabling the aircraft, which then stalled and crashed into a hotel just miles from the airport, killing all the people on board the airplane and four persons on the ground. On April 10, 2003, British Airways and Air France simultaneously announced that they would retire Concorde in October that year. They cited low passenger numbers following the July 25, 2000 crash and rising maintenance costs.\n\nAccording to the passage, a lack of passengers and high costs have brought about ------ .",

The ancient Chinese flew kites. The early inhabitants of Australia invented the boomerang, the blades of which they carved in the shape of an airfoil. As early as the Middle Ages, men of scientific mind prophesied human flight. About 1250, Roger Bacon, an English friar, suggested the orthopter, a machine that flaps its wings like a bird. He also conceived the balloon, proposing \"a hollow globe filled with ethereal air or liquid fire.\" Some 250 years later, the great Italian artist and scientist Leonardo da Vinci studied the flight of birds. About 1490, he drew sketches for flying machines, also of the orthopter type. Leonardo made drawings of a propeller and a helicopter. An Italian monk, Francesco de Lana, in 1670 proposed a vacuum balloon. Four spheres, from which air had been exhausted, were to support a car equipped with oars and a sail. He overlooked the phenomenon of atmospheric pressure, however, which would have crushed the spheres. Not until a hundred years later was the first balloon flown successfully in public. In 1783, J. Etienne and Joseph M. Montgolfier inflated a big paper balloon with hot air, which rose 6,000 feet.\n\nAccording to the passage, over 500 years before the first balloon flight, ------ .",

      "question_text": "-16. BLOOD, SWEAT and TEARS \n\nBlood, Sweat and Tears is an American musical group. A pioneer in the field of jazz rock, the group topped the charts in the late 1960s with their fresh sound. The idea for the group was conceived by Al Kooper, a keyboard player and vocalist who had previously been a member of the Royal Teens and the Blues Project. He wanted to form a band that would expand the scope of rock to include elements of jazz, blues, classical and folk music. The core of the original group included Kooper, Blues Project guitarist Steve Katz, drummer Bobby Colomby and bassist Jim Fielder. Blood, Sweat and Tears added numerous horn players from New York jazz and studio bands before releasing the moderately successful debut album Child is Father to the Man in 1968. It included various Kooper compositions as well as songs by Randy Newman, Carole King and others. Several members, including Kooper, left to pursue other interests after the first album. The band regrouped with David Clayton-Thomas, formerly in the Canadian blues band The Bossmen, as the lead vocalist. The 1969 Grammy-winning album Blood, Sweat and Tears spent more than two years on the United States charts, including seven successive weeks at number one. The group also achieved worldwide recognition, and the US State Department asked the band to do a good will tour abroad. In the early 1970s, the band had hits with 'Hi-De-Ho', 'Lucretia MacEvrl' and 'Go Down Gambling'. A series of singers replaced Clayton-Thomas when he left to pursue a solo career, but he rejoined the group in 1974. With the emergence of otherrock bands with a similar emphasis on brass, the group had trouble duplicating its recording success but became popular on the nightclub circuit. Through the years, more than forty musicians filled the positions of the eight-to-ten-member band.\n\nIt is clear from the passage that, having made one album ------ .",

The recipients — and there have been a total of 94 of them since the prize was launched in 1989 — hail from every region of the globe. Among the profiles of the 2003 award winners is Odigha Odigha, a Nigerian forest activist and educator.Odigha Odigha recalls what it was like as a child to walk to school under the canopy of the rainforest in Cross River State in south-eastern Nigeria. \"You could walk several kilometres without seeing the sun's rays,\" he says. \"You would only hear the sounds of animals, birds and see wonderful butterflies, and come in close contact with nature, run around and pluck some leaves and fruits. As an adventurous kid, I used to enjoy it so much. And, at that time, you could get into fresh water, which was so fresh that you could drink it.\"The rainforest was a paradise in the eyes of the young boy. It had vast stands of hardwoods and was home to the world's endangered gorillas. But 40 years later, the rainforest in Cross River State has become a much different place. \"What we have now is a vast desert encroachment coming in from the north, coming towards the coastal area,\" Mr Odigha says. \"The trees have gone, trees like mahogany, ebony. It is a pathetic situation. I am not sure that we have fully come to terms with what we are losing, what is happening to us as a country.\" A century of excessive and largely unchecked logging has had devastating consequences, says Mr Odigha, \"and today less than 10 percent of Nigeria's original rainforest survives.\"\n\nFrom the description in the passage, Odigha Odigha ------ .",

The auto industry has come a long way from the early 20th century, when Henry Ford offered his Model-T in one \"flavour\": black. Silver and its variations are, by far the most popular exterior finish for new cars in North America, South America and Europe, accounting for 23 percent of new vehicles sold. Bob Daily, colour marketing manager for the major auto paint producer Dupont Performance Coatings, explains why: ''Silver is really a very stylish-looking colour. I think, it's what people equate to things like precision and performance,\" he says. Mr Daily says silver goes well with the new car designs. \"We're getting away from that \"carved bar of soap\" design that we had in the 1980s and 90s into more charming looks. Those kinds of designs are enhanced by colours like silver, as well as black and some of the other colours that are quite popular right now,\" he says. Black is currently number three in popularity. What's second to silver? \"White has been a perennially popular colour. But, surprisingly, over the past five or six years, black has come up considerably in popularity'.\" says Mr Daily. As one colour fades, another is on the rise, according to Mr Daily. \"When green became popular in the early 1990s, blue dropped off the market for quite a while. And now blue is coming back,\" he says. \"Just a few years ago,\" says Bob Daily, \"there were clear differences in colours chosen by car buyers in Asia, Europe and North America. Now, with the advent of the global society and instant communication, those cultural differences are disappearing. And silver is the dominant choice from Berlin to Beijing.\"\n\nAccording to Bob Daily, as reported in the passage, cultural differences ------ .",

As societies became wealthier, and people longerlived, it became highly likely that lower-middle and middle-class people steadily employed would retire in good health and with significant savings. A tourist can usually be seen as clearly \"out of place\" with his current surroundings, so he is not confused with other travellers. The term tourist is tied to the activity of taking a tour or sightseeing. It is not limited to travelling, but used as a description of a person who enters a situation or culture, for a brief time, requiring knowledge that he does not have. The tourist can be interested — among other things — in the new place's culture or its nature. Wealthy people have always travelled to distant parts of the world, not incidentally to some other purpose, but as an end in itself: to see great buildings or other works of art; to learn new languages; or to taste new cuisines. Organised tourism is now a major industry around the world. Many national economies are now heavily reliant on tourism. The term tourism is sometimes used in an uncomplimentary manner, implying a shallow interest by tourists in general in the societies and natural wonders they visit.\n\nAccording to the passage, a tourist ------ .",

It is one of the largest metro systems in the world, which is especially remarkable considering Madrid's less than four million population. It is also one of the fastest growing in the world, rivalled only by Seoul; the latest round of expansions, completed in the spring of 2003, have increased its length to 223 kilometres. The metro opened in 1919 under the direction of the Compania de Metro Alfonso XIII. Metro stations served as air raid shelters during the Spanish Civil War. Starting in the 1970s, it was sequentially greatly expanded to cope with the influx of population and urban sprawl from Madrid's economic ascendancy. A huge project in the late 1990s and early 2000s installed approximately 50 kilometres of new metro tunnels, including a direct connection between downtown Madrid and Barajas International Airport, and service to outlying areas, including a huge 40-kilometre circuit called Metrosur serving Madrid's southern suburbs. Metrosur, the largest civil engineering project in Europe, opened on April 11, 2003. It includes 40.7 kilometres of tunnel and 28 new stations, including an interchange station and an additional station on Line 10, which connects it to downtown. Construction began in June 2000, the whole circuit was completed in less than three years. It connects the towns of Getafe, Möstoles, Alcorcon, Fuenlabrada and Leganes. Madrid also has an extensive commuter train network operated by Renfe, the national rail line, which is integrated with the metro network.

Another theory is that a Dutch nickname Yankey is the source, because as early as 1683 it was used by Dutch sailors. Yankey may have been derived from Janke, a diminutive of the Dutch name Jan. In colonial America the colonists of other regions rather scornfully called New Englanders Yankees. The British did not observe the local distinction and used the term for allof the colonists. During the American Civil War Southerners spoke of all Northerners as Yankees. The British called United States soldiers Yanks in both world wars, and eventually, the term has become popular as a nickname for all Americans. The origin of the song 'Yankee Doodle\" is also uncertain. This sprightly, impudent tune was popular in the colonies by 1770. The British used it to make fun of the Americans early in the Revolution, but the victorious Americans adopted it as their own marching song. The best known verse runs: Yankee Doodle went to town Riding on a pony; Stuck a feather in his hat And called it Macaroni Macaroni was the name given to English dandies.\n\nAccording to the passage, the term Yankee------ .",

      "question_text": "-3. THE REMAINS of THE QUEEN ANNE'S REVENGE\n\nFor more than two and a half centuries, the final resting place of one of history's most notorious sea vessels remained a mystery. In 1718 the Queen Anne's Revenge, which had been the fleet flagship of the infamous pirate Edward Teach, was sunk off the Atlantic coast of the American colonies. Teach, known popularly as Black beard, escaped from the sinking vessel along with his crew. Legend has it that they were able to save the vast treasures they had accumulated during two years of plundering ships and towns along the Eastern seaboard. Although the whereabouts of the rumoured treasure remained unknown, marine archaeologists working off the coast of North Carolina discovered what they believed to be the sunken remains of the Queen Anne's Revenge. The hull of the ship apparently settled near where it was reported to have sunk, in water little more than 6 metres deep and less than 2 miles from the coast. The location of the ship had remained undetermined for more than 270 years mostly because of the clutter of other ships at the bottom of the ocean in that area. Since the time of the ship's sinking, literally hundreds of ships had come to rest in the vicinity of the suspected resting place of the Queen Anne's Revenge. The team of marine archaeologists, however, consulted a rare book from 1719 that chronicled the story of the sinking of Black beard’s notorious ship, which ran ashore in 1718 while attempting to enter Beaufort inlet near North Carolina. The book provided an exact description of the location where the ship went down, and the marine archaeologists were able to locate the ship using that information and a sophisticated device designed to detect large amounts of metal. This device made it possible for the archaeologists to detect the ship's numerous cannons. In November 1996, after a decade-long process of research and underwater searching, the team finally located the hull of a ship that seemed consistent with known information concerning the design of the Queen Anne's Revenge.\n\nThe remains of the ship described in the passage were found------ .",

As a young writer, Hinton decided to write under her initials in order to deflect attention from her gender. She set out to write about the difficult social system that teenagers create among themselves. Her books struck a chord with adolescents who saw in her characters many elements of this system that existed in their own schools and towns. In 1967, while she was still in high school, Hinton published her first book. The Outsiders. The story of confrontation between rival groups of teenagers was immediately successful with critics and young readers, and it won several awards. There was some controversy about the level of violence in the novel and in her other works, but Hinton was praised for her realistic and explosive dialogue. The financial, as well as literary, success of The Outsiders enabled Hinton to continue her education in college. She graduated from the University of Tulsa in 1970. Her other novels for young adults included That Was Then, This Is Now, published in 1971, Rumble Fish, in 1975, Tex, 1979, and Taming the Star Runner, in 1988.

      "question_text": "-7. ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM\n\n Studies have shown that not all individuals are equally exposed to pollution. For example, worldwide toxic-waste sites are more prevalent in poorer communities. In the United States the single most important factor in predicting the location of such sites is the ethnic composition of a neighbourhood. Three of the five largest commercial hazardous-waste landfills in America are in predominantly black or Hispanic neighbourhoods, and three out of every five black or Hispanic Americans live in the vicinity of an uncontrolled toxic-waste site. The wealth of a community is not nearly as good a predictor of hazardous-waste locations as the ethnic background of the residents, suggesting that the selection of sites for hazardous-waste disposal involves racism. Environmental racism takes international forms as well. American corporations often continue to produce dangerous, US-banned chemicals and ship them to developing countries. In addition, the developed world has shipped large amounts of toxic waste to developing countries for unsafe disposal. For instance, experts estimate that 50 to 80 percent of electronic waste produced in the United States, including computer parts, is shipped to waste sites in developing countries, such as China and India. At a waste site in Giuyu, China, labourers with no protective clothing regularly burn plastics and circuit boards from old computers. They pour acid on electronic parts to extract silver and gold, and they smash cathode-ray tubes from computer monitors to remove lead. These activities so pollute the groundwater beneath the site that drinking water is brought to the area by trucks from a town 29 km away.\n\nThe author of the passage seems to believe that, the first consideration in the selection of a place for toxic-waste disposal is ------ .",

Celebrated around the world by millions of people of African descent, the week-long holiday of Kwanzaa was developed by the American scholar and activist Maniana Karenga in 1966. Kwanzaa celebrates African family, community and culture. It is based on African harvest celebrations, and the name comes from the Swahili for \"first fruits of harvest.\" It takes place from December 26 to January 1, a time that in some African cultures is called \"the time when the edges of the year meet\" and is traditionally spent in celebration, focus and assessment. The symbolism of the festival comes from various African traditions. Each night, one or more of seven candles arranged in a candleholder — one black, three red and three green — is lit, and one of seven principles is discussed: unity, self-determination, collective work, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith. These are considered the highest ethical and cultural values and are also known as the seven principles of African American community development. Kwanzaa is represented by seven symbols: crops, a mat, a candleholder, the seven candles, ears of corn, gifts and a unity cup, the Kikome Cha Umoja. All seven symbols are put on a straw mat. The celebrants use the unity cup to pour libations for the ancestors and they drink, from it to reinforce unity in the family and community. The candles are lit alternately from left to right. On the first night, the black candle in the center, symbolising the black people, is lit; on the second night, the black one and the first candle to its left, a red one, symbolising their struggle; on the third night, the first two and the green one to the right of the black one, which symbolises the future and hope which comes from the struggle; and so on each night, alternating left to right. Gifts such as books or heritage symbols relating to the history, culture or community of African Americans are exchanged; they are primarily given to children, but other family members can also exchange gifts.\n\nAccording to the passage, Kwanzaa ------ .",

Later, minor offenders and debtors were imprisoned — since major offenders were executed. Prisons were mainly places to put people away and forget about them. Thus they were neglected and poorly run institutions subject to terrible overcrowding, filth and disease. Charles Dickens presented a vivid picture of life in London's famous Marshalsea debtors' prison in his novel Little Dorrit; published in 1857. Even more famous were London's Newgate and Fleet prisons for their overcrowding, filth and violence. In Great Britain the movement to reform prisons was begun in 1773 by John Howard, the appointed sheriif oi Bedfordshire. His reports on prison conditions, especially The State of the Prisons', spurred a sweeping reform movement that was also influential in the United States. His reports coincided with an extreme overcrowding of British prisons, in part because transportation of criminals to overseas colonies had diminished. So overcrowded were some prisons that many criminals were housed on decaying ships in the Thames River. The Prisons Act of 1791 was the first step toward creating a national prison system and alleviating the worst conditions.\n\nAccording to the passage, prisoners in the earliest English prisons most likely ------ .",

      "corrected_question": "BRITAIN'S EARLIER PRISONS\n\nIn England the first use of prisons was to house vagrants and other idle persons. Later, minor offenders and debtors were imprisoned — since major offenders were executed. Prisons were mainly places to put people away and forget about them. Thus they were neglected and poorly run institutions subject to terrible overcrowding, filth and disease. Charles Dickens presented a vivid picture of life in London's famous Marshalsea debtors' prison in his novel Little Dorrit, published in 1857. Even more famous were London's Newgate and Fleet prisons for their overcrowding, filth and violence. In Great Britain the movement to reform prisons was begun in 1773 by John Howard, the appointed sheriff of Bedfordshire. His reports on prison conditions, especially 'The State of the Prisons', spurred a sweeping reform movement that was also influential in the United States. His reports coincided with an extreme overcrowding of British prisons, in part because transportation of criminals to overseas colonies had diminished. So overcrowded were some prisons that many criminals were housed on decaying ships in the Thames River. The Prisons Act of 1791 was the first step toward creating a national prison system and alleviating the worst conditions.",

With his Iliad, from the book itself as well as the archaeological excavations that support it, it is reasonable to infer a real historical event as background. With the Odyssey, such an assumption is impossible. The book is a tale of adventure at sea and of homecoming after a long absence. These two themes have pervaded Western literature ever since the Homeric epic was written, and the story may well have proved a popular one well before Greek history began. The story could just as well have stood on its own without any relation to the conflict of the Greeks with Troy. The vividly fictional characteristics of the story have not prevented critics, past and present, from seeking to place it in a specific geographic context. Hesiod, who wrote later than Homer, believed that Odysseus and his ships sailed around in the general area of Italy and Sicily, to the west of Ithaca. Later analysts tried to set the wanderings within the Mediterranean Sea generally, while others suggested the Atlantic Ocean as more likely. The ancient astronomer Eratosthenes, who lived in the 2nd century BC, regarded all such speculations as foolish. For him, the world of Odysseus was a completely imaginary one. Indications of this are found within the text itself. Some of the hero's wanderings could well have been based on the even older story of Jason and his Argonauts, who sailed east in search of the golden fleece.

Our pistachio forests in Badghis and Takhar in the north are gone, or at least 90 percent of them are lost,\" says Yusuf Nuristani, Afghanistan's minister of irrigation, water resources and environment. A recent report by the United Nations Environment Program warns that Afghanistan faces a future without forests, clean water, wildlife or unpolluted air if current trends are not reversed. The report says Afghanistan's environmental damage is a \"major stumbling block\" to reconstruction and development. It is not only Afghanistan's forests that are disappearing though. Five years of drought and the destruction of a centuries-old canal network have left many Afghans without clean drinking water or water for irrigation. The U.N. report says even good news, such as the return of more than one million refugees to Afghanistan last year, has hurt the environment, choking major cities with exhaust fumes and overloading the sewer systems. Mr Nuristani says a quarter century of war has left his country environmentally devastated. \"Right now, we are in a mess. The drought, the war, the neglect and the low level of understanding among the people about the environment have caused all these problems. So we have to intervene right now in whatever way we can,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the passage, damage to Afghanistan's natural environment ------ .",

      "question_text": "-14. ORGANIC FARMING\n\nThe discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century brought remarkable changes to modern medicine, enabling people to live longer, healthier lives. But in the last generation, new strains of bacteria have emerged that are resistant to these wonder drugs. One of the main causes of resistance is the overuse of antibiotics. That includes drugs given to commercially raised livestock, and this leads to serious threat to human health if the animal is diseased. Hence, organic fanning, which means raising animals and crops without using drugs or chemical fertilisers, is gradually becoming popular. New Horizons is such a farm in the state of North Carolina, the USA, that is raising meat without the use of chemicals. Eleven-year-old Chance Lorraine likes to show visitors around. Here, on 20 hectares, his parents raise organic vegetables, pigs, Black Angus beef cattle and chickens. There are also water buffalo. But what really sets New Horizons apart from commercial livestock farms are three metal silos near the pastures. \"We keep feed in all three of these. That's cow feed, that's chicken feed, and the other one is pig feed,\" says Chance. The feed is special because of what it doesn't have: no growth hormones, no animal by-products, no chemicals against worms and no antibiotics. The animals in the field that eat this feed eventually end up in cold storage at the New Horizons Farm store.\n\nAccording to the passage, over the last fifty years or so, ------ .",

The festival ended with a fireworks display after the London Community Gospel choir gave the final performance, delivering a message of hope. There are some Zimbabweans who feel, because of the economic and political crisis, the festival should not have been held this year. Some say holding the festival sends a message that things are normal in Zimbabwe. They even launched a mail campaign to make their point. But the festival's founder and director, London-based Zimbabwean concert pianist Manuel Bagorro, argues that Zimbabwe needs the festival now more than at any other time. \"I believe that this is absolutely the most important time to do something of this nature,\" said Mr Bagorro. \"I think that any initiative that nurtures any section of our community is incredibly important at this time when people are so desperate. My decision to keep the festival right in the centre of the city, despite concerns about security, and concerns about petty crime and so on, is some effort on behalf of the festival to acknowledge the reality of the situation.\" ''Yes, it is true you walk out of the gates of the festival and are confronted with the destitution of many, many Zimbabweans,\" he continued. \"However, it seems to me that to cancel a festival like this achieves nothing.\" Despite the controversy, thousands of people who could afford the modestly priced tickets and had the fuel to go to the city centre attended the festival. Zimbabwe's difficult times include 80 percent unemployment, shortages of basic commodities, and a political crisis that is splitting the nation. But for the last week, the Harare International Festival of the Arts provided, at least, some distraction.\n\nAccording to the passage, some Zimbabweans believed it was inappropriate to go ahead with the festival because ------ .",

      "question_text": "-16. KATHERINE MANSFIELD\n\nGifted with a keen insight into human character, Katherine Mansfield wrote a number of almost perfect short stories. Much of her work is based on incidents and scenes from her own life. She was born Kathleen Beauchamp in Wellington, New Zealand, on October 14, 1888, as the daughter of a banker. Katherine Mansfield was her pen name. Her early years were spent in the village of Karori, near Wellington. In 1903, when she was 15, she went to London to study at Queen's College. After three years she reluctantly returned to New Zealand. In 1908 she persuaded her father to provide her with an allowance and allow her to live in England. She had become an accomplished cellist, but she now turned to writing. After a brief unhappy marriage, Mansfield met John Middleton Murry. He was then an Oxford undergraduate, but he was soon to become a well-known critic. Their marriage was successful. Murry wrote: \"She was natural and spontaneous as no other human being I have ever met.\" Deeply distressed by the death of her only brother, Leslie, in World War I, and already suffering from poor health, she went to the French Riviera in 1916. There she began to write the stories for which she is best known, tales of her childhood in New Zealand. She died of tuberculosis in a sanatorium in France on January 9, 1923.In her career, Mansfield strove for a pure style that would express simple reality. Her writing is sensitive, reflecting subtle variations in mood. In a German Pension, a collection of short stories, was published in 1911. Not until 1920 with Bliss and Other Stories did she obtain recognition, though. After her death, Murry brought out several volumes of her writings that had not previously been published.\n\nAccording to the passage Kathleen Mansfield had the ability------ .",

WILLIAM TELL\n\nEarly in the 14th century, the village of Altdorf in Switzerland was supposedly ruled by a tyrannical Austrian governor named Gessler, who placed a hat on top of a pole as a symbol of Austrian power. According to the legend, the people were ordered to bow to it as though it were the duke of Austria. A skilled crossbowman named William Tell refused to do this. Soldiers took him and his son Walter before Gessler. The cruel Gessler ordered Tell to shoot an apple off Walter's head at 100 paces. Tell took an arrow from his quiver and slipped it under his belt. He took another and fired it from his bow. The arrow pierced the apple. Gessler asked Tell what the first arrow had been intended for. \"To slay you, tyrant, had I killed my son.\" In a rage Gessler sent Tell to prison. Tell fled during a storm and soon after killed Gessler. Swiss legends place these events in the year 1307. In the country's actual history, in 1315, the men of the three forest-cantons — Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden — defeated an invading Austrian army. They then renewed and enlarged the Everlasting League, which helped lay the foundation of Swiss independence. William Tell first appeared in Swiss literature in the second half of the 15th century. In 1804 the German poet Friedrich Schiller made the legend the subject of a drama, and the Italian composer Gioacchino Rossini used it in an opera in 1829.\n\nAccording to the passage, Gessler made all the citizens of Altdorf ------ .",

Leaving Turkey, the Tigris touches the north-eastern border of Syria and then flows south-eastward across Iraq. In Iraq it is joined by tributaries from the east — principally the Great Zab, Little Zab and Diyala. The Euphrates, west of the Tigris, runs in the same general direction. In ancient times, the two rivers had separate mouths. Now they meet in a swamp in southern Iraq and form a single stream, the Shatt al 'Arab, which flows into the head of the Persian Gulf. The Tigris, 1,900 kilometres long, is shorter than the Euphrates, but it is more important commercially because its channel is deeper. The fertile region between the Tigris and the Euphrates was called Mesopotamia by the ancient Greeks. Here flourished the earliest known civilisation. The Tigris was the great river of Assyria. The ancient city of Assur, which gave its name to Assyria, stood on its banks, as did Nineveh, Assyria's splendid capital. Much later the Macedonian general Seleucus built his capital city Seleucia on the Tigris, and across the river from Seleucia the Parthian kings built Ctesiphori. The chief cities on the river today are Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, and Mosul, farther upstream. River steamers make regular trips between Basra, a modern port on the Shatt al 'Arab, and Baghdad.

HOME OFFICE — THE SHORTEST COMMUTING\n\n \"A home office allowed me to maintain the career pace I was on,\" says Colleen Clark, reflecting on three years of telecommuting between Sacramento, California, and Richland, Washington When Clark and her husband decided to move to California, she looked for a way to keep her job with a public relations company that contracts with the federal government. To that end, she proposed a telecommuting schedule that had her at home in California for three weeks and on location in Washington for one week each month. Her company astounded her and said yes. It hadn't been done before, but now the company is looking into ways to encourage more people to try telecommuting. A home office loft was added to Clark's plans for the new house in Sacramento. Though open to the second floor of the house, the loft was designed to be self-contained and separate from the rest of the house. Extra phone lines were installed during construction. Her employer arranged for her to have remote access to the Local Area Network, processed through an autodial feature with a built-in calling card. Clark's office phone in Richland automatically bounced callers to her Sacramento address. \"A lot of callers didn't realise I wasn't on site,\" she says. Adapting to working at home was \"a learning experience,\" Clark admits. She found that it was important to minimise distractions. \"Everything needs to be in the work area,\" she says, \"so that you're not up and down, back and forth.\" She also came to realise that her work benefited if she followed a routine of getting ready for work as if she were going to a regular workplace. \"At first, it seems cool to roll out of bed in your pyjamas and sit down to work still bleary eyed — it's the shortest commuting in history; it's really a dream. But I learned that it was important to stick to a professional routine. In this manner, I find it easy to stay focused.\"\n\nAccording to the passage, Colleen Clark found it helpful when working at home to ------ .",

Yes, your meal is nutritious. But isn't it more than you bargained for? In an era when consumers look for great deals, it often seems as though the bigger things are, the better value for your money. \"Supersize it,\" the slogan from a fast-food restaurant chain, seems to sum it up. But more isn't always better — particularly when it comes to weight loss. Sometimes leaving a little food on your plate is worth much more than the dollar it might cost. Watching your total food intake, not just limiting unhealthy foods, is the key to good health and permanent weight loss. Healthy foods are not without any restrictions. Excess calories from any food, not just fatty or fried ones, can cause weight gain. In today's \"themore- you-get-the-better\" society, package sizes keep growing. Giant bottles of soda, extra large bags of chips and king-size candy bars are all the rage. But as these foods get larger, so do our waistlines. Bigger packages and food items apparently distort portion control. In fact, research from the University of Illinois shows that some people tend to eat more from larger food containers. When movie-goers were given popcorn containers of two different sizes, the people given the larger ones ate 44 percent more.\n\nAccording to the passage, it is the trend today ------ .",

A psychologist has reported the case of a girl who was intensely afraid of spiders. Even the most harmless little red mite would provoke a scream and symptoms of uncontrollable fear. It was found that when she was small she had been bitten by a large spider.

      "corrected_question": "PHOBIA\n\nThe process of conditioning no doubt plays an important role in emotional life and in everyday likes and dislikes. A psychologist has reported the case of a girl who was intensely afraid of spiders. Even the most harmless little red mite would provoke a scream and symptoms of uncontrollable fear. It was found that when she was small she had been bitten by a large spider. The bite itself was not serious, and she might have taken it in a matter-of-fact way, except for her mother's excitement and distress. The girl's normal reflex from the pain of the bite became conditioned by her mother's excitement so that it resulted in extravagant terror at the mere sight of a spider.

Although it is only 338 kilometres long, it is England's chief waterway. The Thames begins at Seven Springs in the Cotswold Hills. From there it pursues a very winding course through the Chiltern Hills. At Oxford, the famous university town, it is met by its chief western tributary, the River Cherwell. This is the beginning of commercial navigation. From here the river flows through the English countryside, passing such well-known sites as Henley, where the annual regatta is held; the royal residence at Windsor Castle; the college town of Eton; Hampton, famous for its beautiful Hampton Court Palace built during the reign of Henry VIII; and then on to London. By the time the Thames reaches London, it has become an estuary, a section of the North Sea affected by the tides. The river flows for 40 kilometres through Greater London, past the Tate Gallery, Lambeth Palace, the houses of Parliament, the Royal Festival Hall and National Theatre complex, Southwark Cathedral, and the Tower of London.\n\nMany people know about the Thames because ------ .",

For instant character analysis, distinct personality traits have been identified with each of the signs. Many people still like to check their daily horoscope for the general outlook of their sign. Others have their own personal horoscopes drawn up for more specific information that might help them make wiser decisions. Today, with the help of computers, astrologers can make the complex mathematical computations for a horoscope in five or ten minutes. Such computations used to take hours or even days. Many professional astrologers use computers in this way to save their time and energy for the art of interpreting the data. No one has been able to prove the scientific accuracy of astrological predictions. Results vary with the individual astrologer's interpretive skill — a skill that is part intuition and part training. Attempts to measure and define such skill have been inconclusive.\n\nWe understand from the passage that many people consult their horoscopes ------ .",

A group of about 90 migrants led by George Donner were caught in a blinding snowstorm in the mountains of California in 1846. Survivors had been forced to resort to eating the flesh of their dead comrades to live. Such eating of human flesh by humans is called cannibalism. The word comes from the Arawakan language name for the Carib Indians, who were well known for their practice of cannibalism. The word is also used in a zoological sense to refer to the eating of any animal by another member of the same species. Wolves, for instance, will devour each other when desperately hungry. Among humans, cannibalism has been widespread in prehistoric and primitive societies. It is still believed to be practised in remote areas of the island of New Guinea. It existed until recently in parts of Africa, Sumatra, Melanesia, and Polynesia; among various Indian tribes of the Americas; and among the aborigines of Australia and the Maoris of New Zealand.\n\nSome members of the Donner party ------ .",

The nose, ears, fingers, toes and chin are the most susceptible. The involved part begins to tingle or hurt mildly and then becomes numb. Frozen tissue usually ranges from distinctly white in light-skinned persons to ashen grey in dark-skinned persons. Here are some tips to help rescue someone with frostbite: 1, Remove the person from the cold as soon as it is possible. 2, Every effort should be made to protect the frozen part. If there is a chance that the part might refreeze before reaching medical care, it may be more harmful to thaw it and let it refreeze than to await arrival at the treatment area for thawing. 3, Rapid rewarming is essential. Do not rub the injured part; friction may cause further damage. Use lukewarm water or use warmed blankets. Within about 30 minutes sensation may return to the part, which may become red, swollen and painful. 4, When the part is warm, keep it dry and clean. If blisters appear, use sterile dressings.\n\nWe learn from the passage that frostbite ------ .",

Nobody in the 19th century contributed more than he did to make the concept of fine restaurant dining a reality in America. Delmonico, born in Switzerland in 1813, went to New York at the age of 19 and worked with relatives in a catering firm. He soon opened a restaurant that offered an unusually large menu, including a great variety of European dishes never before served in the United States. He also served American wild game as well as a selection of wines. The success of the restaurant inspired him to open branch restaurants, including-the internationally renowned Delmonico's on the corner of Broadway and 26th Street in New York City. His organisation also operated its own farm in nearby Brooklyn and temporarily ran a hotel. His fame as a restaurateur brought many imitators, and between them they helped make New York City one of the primary culinary centres in the world. He was largely responsible for making the restaurant an accepted and popular institution.\n\nOne of the factors that made Delmonico's first restaurant different from other restaurants was that ------ .",

When 'Madame Bovary' first appeared --in 1856, as a magazine serial -- Flaubert was brought to trial for publishing a morally offensive work. He was acquitted in 1857, and in the same year, the novel came out in book form. During his later years, Flaubert spent the winter in Paris, where he held literary gatherings. Flaubert never married, and died on May 8th, 1880.\n\nFlaubert took five years to write 'Madame Bovary' because ------ .",

The mothers provide milk for the young for a year or more. Like other whales, dolphins have lungs and breathe through a single nostril, called the blowhole, located on top of the head. The blowhole is opened during their frequent trips to the surface to breathe. In contrast to some of the large whales, dolphins and porpoises have teeth, which they use to seize their food, consisting primarily of marine fish. Certain species of marine dolphins are the best-known biologically because they survive well in captivity, which means they can be more carefully observed. The bottle-nosed dolphin has been the most intensively studied because of its adaptability to salt-water holding tanks. It is a major participant in acrobatic shows at oceanariums and is noted for its curiosity toward humans.\n\nOne of the differences between some whales and dolphins is that, ------ .",
